## Project Overview

This project analyzes movies datasets from various movie rating sites (through Exploratory Data Analysis), to assist the head of Microsoft's new movie studio  in deciding what type of films to create under their new venture.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Business understanding

Microsoft faces competition with market leaders who possess profound industry expertise from the past.
Microsoft must carefully consider the kinds of films that have the best chance of being profitable, popular, and low in production costs if it is to prosper in this cutthroat market.

In this case study, business savvy entails Microsoft seeing the chance to enter the film industry, particularly by opening a new studio.Microsoft wants to use its resources and brand to build on the fact that many successful businesses are producing unique video content, which is what motivated them to make this move.


Here are the questions to guide through;

1. Find out if venturing into the firm industry is a viable business idea for microsoft
2. Find out what how production cost is related to the total revenue
3. Find out how popularity of a movie relates to its vote count

### The Data understanding

There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:

Box Office Mojo.
IMDB.
Rotten Tomatoes
TheMovieDB.
The Numbers

This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from three movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo, The MovieDB and The Numbers

  1.The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.
  2.The second dataset, The movie DB ,has 9 columns comprising of genre_id, ids, original_language, title, popularity, release dates, vote_count and vote_average.  
  3.tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. 


## Data Analysis
During my analysis phase, I mostly focused on examining the relationships between the previously cleaned data and creating visual representations.

## conclusion

Here are my findings;

  1.The production budget plays a major role for  profitabitty in the film industries . this may be attributed to major factors like marketing cost,investing in popular movie actors and directors  which come at a higher cost, lunguage intepretation of the original film etc.

  2.There is a strong positive correlation between domestic_gross and worldwide_gross. this means that if a movie does  well in the local market, it will also perform well in the international market.

  3.Popularity of a film doesn't guarantee the profitabilty of the film. From our analysis, there is a very weak positive correlation between the two meaning that profitability of a firm is not based on how popular their movies are.

## recommendation

1.Because there is a strong positive correlation between production budget and both domestic and worldwide box office receipts, it is important to allocate your budget wisely for film production. This will allow you to hire top producers, marketers, and well-known actors, all of which will help your project become more successful and profitable.

2.Prioritize on domestic film marketing since it will have a significant impact on the international and foreign markets' viability and profitability.Our investigation revealed a significant positive link between domestic gross and worldwide gross.

3.It is evident that a film's profitability is significantly influenced by variables other than popularity.approach would entail changing up the movie, emphasizing quality, and implementing a marketing plan that aims to attract the target market.
