## Project Overview

This project analyzes movies datasets from various movie rating sites (through Exploratory Data Analysis), to assist the head of Microsoft's new movie studio  in deciding what type of films to create under their new venture.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Business understanding
Microsoft faces the challenge of competing against industry giants armed with historical industry insights.
To thrive in this competitive industry , microsoft needs to strategically determine the types of movies that are most likely to succeed in terms of profitability,production cost and its popularity

Business understanding in this scenario involves microsoft recognizing the opportunity to enter the film industry, specifically by establishing a new movie studio .This decision is driven by observation that many successful companies are creating original video content, and microsoft wants to leverage its resources and brand to tap into this market

Here are the questions to guide through;

1. Find out if venturing into the firm industry is a viable business idea for microsoft
2. Find out what how production cost is related to the total revenue
3. Find out how popularity of a movie relates to its vote count

### The Data understanding

There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:

Box Office Mojo.
IMDB.
Rotten Tomatoes
TheMovieDB.
The Numbers

This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from three movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo, The MovieDB and The Numbers

  1.The first dataset, bom.movie_gross.csv, has five columns comprising of movie titles, studios, financial incomes both domestic and foreign and the release year.
  2.The second dataset, The movie DB ,has 9 columns comprising of genre_id, ids, original_language, title, popularity, release dates, vote_count and vote_average.  
  3.tn.movie_budgets.csv, contains information on released films, including their names, release dates, and financial data such as production budget and worldwide gross. 


## Data Analysis
My analysis stage majorly forcused  on exploring the correlationships in the previously cleaned data and  come up with visualisations.

## conclusion

Here are my findings;

  1.The production budget plays a major role for  profitabitty in the film industries . this may be attributed to major factors like marketing cost,investing in popular movie actors and directors  which come at a higher cost, lunguage intepretation of the original film etc.

  2.There is a strong positive correlation between domestic_gross and worldwide_gross. this means that if a movie does  well in the local market, it will also perform well in the international market.

  3.Popularity of a film doesn't guarantee the profitabilty of the film. From our analysis, there is a very weak positive correlation between the two meaning that profitability of a firm is not based on how popular their movies are.

## recommendation

1.Because there is a strong positive correlation between production budget and both domestic and worldwide box office receipts, it is important to allocate your budget wisely for film production. This will allow you to hire top producers, marketers, and well-known actors, all of which will help your project become more successful and profitable.

2.Focus on marketing the films in the  domestic market as this will determine the sucess/ profitability  of the film in the internatinal and foreign  markets.As noted in our analysis, there was a strong positive correlation between domestic_gross and wolrdwide _gross

3.it's clear that factors other than popularity play significant roles in determining a film's profitability.that would include diversifying the content,focusing on quality and adopting a market strategy that aim to reach the right audience
