## Project Overview

This project analyzes movies datasets from various movie rating sites (through Exploratory Data Analysis), to assist the head of Microsoft's new movie studio  in deciding what type of films to create under their new venture.

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

### Business understanding
Microsoft faces the challenge of competing against industry giants armed with historical industry insights.
To thrive in this competitive industry , microsoft needs to strategically determine the types of movies that are most likely to succeed in terms of profitability,production cost and its popularity

Business understanding in this scenario involves microsoft recognizing the opportunity to enter the film industry, specifically by establishing a new movie studio .This decision is driven by observation that many successful companies are creating original video content, and microsoft wants to leverage its resources and brand to tap into this market

Here are the questions to guide through;

1. Find out if venturing into the firm industry is a viable business idea for microsoft
2. Find out what how production cost is related to the total revenue
3. Find out how popularity of a movie relates to its vote count

### The Data understanding

There were four data sets provided each containing different data. The data sets were:

Box Office Mojo.
IMDB.
Rotten Tomatoes

The Numbers

This analysis utilizes datasets acquired from three movie websites, namely Box Office Mojo, The MovieDB and The Numbers
